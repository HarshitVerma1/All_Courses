There is something at the bottom of every new
human thought, every thought of genius, or even
every earnest thought that springs up in any
brain, which can never be communicated to others,
even if one were to write volumes about it and
were explaining one's idea for thirty-five years;
there's something left which cannot be induced to
emerge from your brain, and remains with you
forever.

- Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Idiot
