# Part B: Problem 4: TreatedPatient Class
# 10.0/10.0 points (graded)
# We also need a representation for a patient that accounts for the use of drug treatments and manages a collection of ResistantVirus
# instances. For this, we introduce the TreatedPatient class, which is a subclass of Patient. TreatedPatient must make use of the new
# methods in ResistantVirus and maintain the list of drugs that are administered to the patient.

# Drugs are given to the patient using the TreatedPatient class's addPrescription() method. What happens when a drug is introduced? The
# drugs we consider do not directly kill virus particles lacking resistance to the drug, but prevent those virus particles from
# reproducing (much like actual drugs used to treat HIV). Virus particles with resistance to the drug continue to reproduce normally.
# Implement the TreatedPatient class.

# Hint: reproduce function child resistances
# If you are really unsure about how to think about what each child resistances should be changed to, here is a different approach. If
# the probability mutProb is successful, the child resistance switches. Otherwise, the child resistance stays the same as the parent
# resistance.

# If you want to use numpy arrays, you should import numpy as np and use np.METHOD_NAME in your code.


# Enter your definitions for the ResistantVirus and TreatedPatient classes in this box.

        """
        Stochastically determines whether this virus particle reproduces at a
        time step. Called by the update() method in the TreatedPatient class.

        A virus particle will only reproduce if it is resistant to ALL the drugs
        in the activeDrugs list. For example, if there are 2 drugs in the
        activeDrugs list, and the virus particle is resistant to 1 or no drugs,
        then it will NOT reproduce.

        Hence, if the virus is resistant to all drugs
        in activeDrugs, then the virus reproduces with probability:      

        self.maxBirthProb * (1 - popDensity).                       

        If this virus particle reproduces, then reproduce() creates and returns
        the instance of the offspring ResistantVirus (which has the same
        maxBirthProb and clearProb values as its parent). The offspring virus
        will have the same maxBirthProb, clearProb, and mutProb as the parent.

        For each drug resistance trait of the virus (i.e. each key of
        self.resistances), the offspring has probability 1-mutProb of
        inheriting that resistance trait from the parent, and probability
        mutProb of switching that resistance trait in the offspring.       

        For example, if a virus particle is resistant to guttagonol but not
        srinol, and self.mutProb is 0.1, then there is a 10% chance that
        that the offspring will lose resistance to guttagonol and a 90%
        chance that the offspring will be resistant to guttagonol.
        There is also a 10% chance that the offspring will gain resistance to
        srinol and a 90% chance that the offspring will not be resistant to
        srinol.

        popDensity: the population density (a float), defined as the current
        virus population divided by the maximum population

        (a list of strings).
