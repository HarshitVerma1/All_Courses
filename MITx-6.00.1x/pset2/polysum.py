Regular Polygons: polysum

A regular polygon has 'n' number of sides. Each side has length 's'.

* The area of regular polygon is: (0.25*n*s^2)/tan(pi/n)
* The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon

Write a function called 'polysum' that takes 2 arguments, 'n' and 's'. This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of the regular polygon. The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.
