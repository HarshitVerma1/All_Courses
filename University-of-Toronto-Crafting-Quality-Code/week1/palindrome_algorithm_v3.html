		<h1>Palindrome: Algorithm 3</h1> 
		<h2>
			Overview
		</h2>
			<p>		
				To determine whether a string is a palindrome, the third algorithm we explored was:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Compare the first character to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.</li>
				<li> Stop when the middle of the string is reached.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>
			 For example, for string <code>"noon"</code>, we compare the first character (<code>"n"</code>) to the last character (<code>"n"</code>), and the second character (<code>"o"</code>) to the second last (<code>"o"</code>). Since both pairs of characters that were compared are equal, <code>"noon"</code> is a palindrome.
		</p>
		<p>

            For a string with an odd length, let's consider
			<code>"racecar"</code>. We compare the first character (<code>"r"</code>) to the last
			character (<code>"r"</code>), the second character (<code>"a"</code>) to the second last (<code>"a"</code>), and the third character (<code>"c"</code>) to the third last character (<code>"c"</code>). The middle character, <code>"e"</code> does not need to be compared with anything. Since all pairs of characters that were compared are equal, <code>"racecar"</code> is a palindrome.	
		</p>	
		<p>
			Finally, for a string that is not a palindrome, let's consider
			<code>"dented"</code>.  We compare the first character (<code>"d"</code>) to the last
			character (<code>"d"</code>), the second character (<code>"e"</code>) to the second last (<code>"e"</code>), and the third character (<code>"n"</code>) to the third last character (<code>"t"</code>). Since <em>not</em> all pairs of characters that were compared are equal, <code>"dented"</code> is a <em>not</em> palindrome.	
			</p>
