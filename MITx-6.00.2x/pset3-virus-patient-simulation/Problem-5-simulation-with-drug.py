# Part B: Problem 5: Running and Analyzing a Simulation With a Drug
# 10.0/10.0 points (graded)
# In this problem, we will use the implementation you filled in for Problem 4 to run a simulation. You will create a TreatedPatient
# instance with the following parameters, then run the simulation:
# viruses, a list of 100 ResistantVirus instances
# maxPop, maximum sustainable virus population = 1000

# Each ResistantVirus instance in the viruses list should be initialized with the following parameters:
# maxBirthProb, maximum reproduction probability for a virus particle = 0.1
# clearProb, maximum clearance probability for a virus particle = 0.05
# resistances, The virus's genetic resistance to drugs in the experiment = {'guttagonol': False}
# mutProb, probability of a mutation in a virus particle's offspring = 0.005

# Run a simulation that consists of 150 time steps, followed by the addition of the drug, guttagonol, followed by another 150 time steps.
# You should make use of the function simulationWithDrug(numViruses, maxPop, maxBirthProb, clearProb, resistances, mutProb, numTrials).
# As with problem 3, perform up to 100 trials and make sure that your results are repeatable and representative.

# Create one plot that records both the average total virus population and the average population of guttagonol-resistant virus particles
# over time.

# A few good questions to consider as you look at your plots are: What trends do you observe? Are the trends consistent with your
# intuition? Feel free to discuss the answers to these questions in the forum, to fully cement your understanding of this problem set,
# processing and interpreting data.

# Again, as in Problem 2, you can use the provided .pyc file to check that your implementation of the TreatedPatient and ResistantVirus
# classes work as expected.

# If you want to use numpy arrays, you should import numpy as np and use np.METHOD_NAME in your code.
