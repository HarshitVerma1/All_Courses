# Part B: Problem 1: Implementing a Simple Simulation (No Drug Treatment)
# 15.0/15.0 points (graded)
# We start with a trivial model of the virus population - the patient does not take any drugs and the viruses do not acquire resistance to
# drugs. We simply model the virus population inside a patient as if it were left untreated.

# SimpleVirus class
# To implement this model, you will need to fill in the SimpleVirus class, which maintains the state of a single virus particle. You will
# implement the methods __init__, getMaxBirthProb, getClearProb,doesClear, and reproduce according to the specifications. Use
# random.random() for generating random numbers to ensure that your results are consistent with ours.

# Hint: random seed
# During debugging, you might want to use random.seed(0) so that your results are reproducible.

# The reproduce method in SimpleVirus should produce an offspring by returning a new instance of SimpleVirus with probability:
# self.maxBirthProb * (1 - popDensity). This method raises a NoChildException if the virus particle does not reproduce. For a reminder on
# raising execptions, review the Python docs.

# self.maxBirthProb is the birth rate under optimal conditions (the virus population is negligible relative to the available host cells so
# there is ample nourishment available). popDensity is defined as the ratio of the current virus population to the maximum virus
# population for a patient and should be calculated in the update method of the Patient class.

# Patient class
# You will also need to implement the Patient class, which maintains the state of a virus population associated with a patient.

# The update method in the Patient class is the inner loop of the simulation. It modifies the state of the virus population for a single
# time step and returns the total virus population at the end of the time step. At every time step of the simulation, each virus
# particle has a fixed probability of being cleared (eliminated from the patient's body). If the virus particle is not cleared, it is
# considered for reproduction. If you utilize the population density correctly, you shouldn't need to provide an explicit check that the
# virus population exceeds maxPop when you are calculating how many offspring are added to the population -- you just calculate the new
# population density and use that for the next call to update.

# Unlike the clearance probability, which is constant, the probability of a virus particle reproducing is a function of the virus
# population. With a larger virus population, there are fewer resources in the patient's body to facilitate reproduction, and the
# probability of reproduction will be lower. One way to think of this limitation is to consider that virus particles need to make use of
# a patient's cells to reproduce; they cannot reproduce on their own. As the virus population increases, there will be fewer available
# host cells for viruses to utilize for reproduction.

# To summarize, update should first decide which virus particles are cleared and which survive by making use of the doesClear method of
# each SimpleVirus instance, then update the collection of SimpleVirus instances accordingly. With the surviving SimpleVirus instances,
# update should then call the reproduce method for each virus particle. Based on the population density of the surviving SimpleVirus
# instances, reproduce should either return a new instance of SimpleVirus representing the offspring of the virus particle, or raise a
# NoChildException indicating that the virus particle does not reproduce during the current time step. The update method should update
# the attributes of the patient appropriately under either of these conditions. After iterating through all the virus particles, the
# update method returns the number of virus particles in the patient at the end of the time step.

# Hint: mutating objects
# Be very wary about mutating an object while iterating over its elements. It is best to avoid this entirely (consider introducing
# additional "helper" variables). See the 6.00.2x Style Guide for more information.

# Note that the mapping between time steps and actual time will vary depending on the type of virus being considered, but for this
# problem set, think of a time step as a simulated hour of time.

# About the grader: When defining a Patient class member variable to store the viruses list representing the virus population, please
# use the name self.viruses in order for your code to be compatible with the grader and to pass one of the tests.

# If you want to use numpy arrays, you should import numpy as np and use np.METHOD_NAME in your code.
