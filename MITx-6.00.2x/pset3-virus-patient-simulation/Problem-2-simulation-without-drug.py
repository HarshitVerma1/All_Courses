# Part B: Problem 2-1: Running and Analyzing a Simple Simulation (No Drug Treatment)
# 10.0/10.0 points (graded)
# You should start by understanding the population dynamics before introducing any drug.

# Fill in the function simulationWithoutDrug(numViruses, maxPop, maxBirthProb, clearProb, numTrials) that instantiates a Patient,
# simulates changes to the virus population for 300 time steps (i.e., 300 calls to update), and plots the average size of the virus
# population as a function of time; that is, the x-axis should correspond to the number of elapsed time steps, and the y-axis should
# correspond to the average size of the virus population in the patient. The population at time=0 is the population after the first call
# to update.

# Run the simulation for numTrials trials, where numTrials in this case can be up to 100 trials. Use pylab to produce a plot (with a
# single curve) that displays the average result of running the simulation for many trials. Make sure you run enough trials so that the
# resulting plot does not change much in terms of shape and time steps taken for the average size of the virus population to become
# stable. Don't forget to include axes labels, a legend for the curve, and a title on your plot.

# You should call simulationWithoutDrug with the following parameters:
# numViruses = 100
# maxPop (maximum sustainable virus population) = 1000
# maxBirthProb (maximum reproduction probability for a virus particle) = 0.1
# clearProb (maximum clearance probability for a virus particle) = 0.05

# Thus, your simulation should be instantiatating one Patient with a list of 100 SimpleVirus instances. Each SimpleVirus instance in the
# viruses list should be initialized with the proper values for maxBirthProb and clearProb.

# Hint: graphing
# Your graph should contain one line that represents the average of many different trials. One way of computing the average involves
# holding all of your data in one list, with one element for each of 300 time steps, and adding to each data point during each trial.
# Then, at the end, each element of the list is divided by the total number of trials, thus taking the average of each element of the
# list. However, if this idea confuses you, feel free to ignore the hint and implement it however makes the most sense to you.

# Consult reference documentation on pylab as reference. Scroll down on the page to find a list of all the plotting commands in pylab.

# Hint: testing your simulation
# Compared to the previous problem sets, testing your simulation code is more challenging, because the behavior of the code is
# stochastic, and the expected output is not exactly known. How do you know whether your plots are correct or not? One way to test this
# is to run the simulation with extreme input values (i.e. initialization parameters), and check that the output matches your intuition.
# For example, if maxBirthProb is set to 0.99 instead of 0.1, then you would expect that the virus population rapidly increases over a
# short period of time. Similarly, if you run your simulation with clearProb = 0.99 and maxBirthProb = 0.1, then you should see the
# virus population quickly decreasing within a small number of steps. You can also try to vary the input values, and check whether the
# output plots change as you expect. For example, if you run multiple simuation runs, each time increasing maxBirthProb, the curves in
# the successive plots should show an "upward" trend, since the virus will reproduce faster with a higher maxBirthProb.

# For further testing, we have provided the .pyc (compiled Python) files for the completed Patient and SimpleVirus classes (and for
# Problem 5, the ResistantVirus and TreatedPatient classes) that you can use to confirm that your code is generating the correct results
# during simulation.

# If you comment out your versions of these classes in ps3b.py, and add the following import statements to the top of your file, you can
# run the simulation using our pre-compiled implementation of these classes to make sure you are obtaining the correct results. This is
# a good way to test if you've implemented these classes correctly. Make sure to comment out the import statement and uncomment your
# implementations before moving to Problem 4.

# If you want to use numpy arrays, you should import numpy as np and use np.METHOD_NAME in your code.

# For Python 3.5: from ps3b_precompiled_35 import *

# For Python 3.6: from ps3b_precompiled_36 import *
