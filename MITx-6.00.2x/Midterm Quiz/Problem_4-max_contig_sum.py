# Problem 5-1
# 1/1 point (graded)
# There are 2 parts to this problem on this page!

# Consider a list of positive (there is at least one positive) and negative numbers. You are asked to find the maximum sum of a
# contiguous subsequence. For example,
# - in the list [3, 4, -1, 5, -4], the maximum sum is 3+4-1+5 = 11
# - in the list [3, 4, -8, 15, -1, 2], the maximum sum is 15-1+2 = 16
# One algorithm goes through all possible subsequences and compares the sums of each contiguous subsequence with the largest sum it has
# seen. What is the time complexity of this algorithm in terms of the length of the list, N?

# O(n^2) Correct

#Problem 4
#20.0/20.0 points (graded)
#Consider a list of positive (there is at least one positive) and negative numbers. You are asked to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence. For example,

#in the list [3, 4, -1, 5, -4], the maximum sum is 3+4-1+5 = 11
#in the list [3, 4, -8, 15, -1, 2], the maximum sum is 15-1+2 = 16
#Write a function that meets the specification below.
