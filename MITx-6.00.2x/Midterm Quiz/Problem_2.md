## Problem 2-1
0 points possible (ungraded)  
Which of the following problems can be solved using dynamic programming? Check all that work.

Sum of elements - Given a list of integer elements, find the sum of all the elements.  
Binary search - Given a list of elements, check if the element X is in the list.  
Dice throws - Given n dice each with m faces, numbered from 1 to m, find the number of ways to get sum X. X is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.  
incorrect

What is the exact probability of rolling at least two 6's when rolling a die three times?

2/27 correct

## Problem 2-3

A greedy optimization algorithm

is typically efficient in time. correct  

## Problem 2-4

Suppose you have a weighted directed graph and want to find a path between nodes A and B with the smallest total weight. Select the most accurate statement.

If all edges have weight 2, breadth-first search guarantees that the first path found to be is the shortest path. correct

## Problem 2-5

Which of the following functions are deterministic?

```python
import random

def F():
    mylist = []
    r = 1

    if random.random() > 0.99:
        r = random.randint(1, 10)
    for i in range(r):
        random.seed(0)
        if random.randint(1, 10) > 3:
            number = random.randint(1, 10)
            if number not in mylist:
                mylist.append(number)
    print(mylist)

def G():  
    random.seed(0)
    mylist = []
    r = 1

    if random.random() > 0.99:
        r = random.randint(1, 10)
    for i in range(r):
        if random.randint(1, 10) > 3:
            number = random.randint(1, 10)
            mylist.append(number)
            print(mylist)
```

Both F and G correct
