#Problem 1: Curve Fitting
#15/15 points (graded)
#Implement the generate_models function.
#
#x and y are two lists corresponding to the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the data samples (or data points); for example, if you have N data points, x = [x1 , x2 , ..., xN ] and y = [y1 , y2 , ..., yN ], where x_i and y_i are the x and y coordinate of the i-th data points. In this problem set, each x coordinate is an integer and corresponds to the year of a sample (e.g., 1997)Í¾ each corresponding y coordinate is a float and represents the temperature observation (will be computed in multiple ways) of that year in Celsius. This representation will be used throughout the entire problem set.
#degs is a list of integers indicating the degree of each regression model that we want to create. For each model, this function should fit the data (x,y) to a polynomial curve of that degree.
#This function should return a list of models. A model is the numpy 1d array of the coefficients of the fitting polynomial curve. Each returned model should be in the same order as their corresponding integer in degs.
#Example:
#
#print(generate_models([1961, 1962, 1963],[4.4,5.5,6.6],[1, 2]))
#Should print something close to:
#
#[array([ 1.10000000e+00, -2.15270000e+03]), array([ -8.86320195e-14, 1.10000000e+00, -2.15270000e+03])]
#The above example was generating a linear and a quadratic curve on data samples (xi, yi ) = (1961, 4.4), (1962, 5.5), and (1963, 6.6). The resulting models are in the same order as specified in degs. Note that it is fine you did not get the exact number because of numerical errors.
#
#Note: If you want to use numpy arrays, you should import numpy as np and use np.METHOD_NAME in your code. Unfortunately, pylab does not work with the grader
