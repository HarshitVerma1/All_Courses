# Problem 8 Part A
# Bookmark this page

# For this problem you are going to simulate growth of fox and rabbit population in a forest!

# The following facts are true about the fox and rabbit population:
# The maximum population of rabbits is determined by the amount of vegetation in the forest, which is relatively stable.
# There are never fewer than 10 rabbits; the maximum population of rabbits is 1000.
# For each rabbit during each time step, a new rabbit will be born with a probability of prabbit reproduction

#                             prabbit reproduction=1.0âˆ’current rabbit populationmax rabbit population
# In other words, when the current population is near the maximum, the probability of giving birth is very low, and when the current
# population is small, the probability of giving birth is very high.

# The population of foxes is constrained by number of rabbits.

# There are never fewer than 10 foxes.

# At each time step, after the rabbits have finished reproducing, a fox will try to hunt a rabbit with success rate of pfox eats rabbit

#                               pfox eats rabbit=current rabbit populationmax rabbit population
# In other words, the more rabbits, the more likely a fox will eat one.

# If a fox succeeds in hunting, it will decrease the number of rabbits by 1 immediately. Remember that the population of rabbits is
# never lower than 10.

# Additionally, if a fox succeeds in hunting, then it has a 1/3 probability of giving birth in the current time-step.

# If a fox fails in hunting then it has a 10 percent chance of dying in the current time-step.

# If the starting population is below 10 then you should do nothing. You should not increase the population nor set the population to
# 10. 
# Start with 500 rabbits and 30 foxes.

# At the end of each time step, record the number of foxes and rabbits.

# Run the simulation for 200 time steps, and then plot the population of rabbits and the population of foxes as a function of time step.
# (You do not need to paste your code for plotting for Part A of this problem).

# Use the following steps, and the template file rabbits.py (click to download .py file), as guides in your implementation of this
# simulation.

# Step 1: Write the procedure, rabbitGrowth, that updates the number of rabbits during the first part of a time step
# Step 2: Write the procedure, foxGrowth, that updates the number of rabbits and foxes during the second part of a time step
# Step 3: Write the master procedure, runSimulation, that loops for some amount of time steps, doing the first part and then the second
# part of the simulation. Record the two populations in two different lists, and return those lists.

# Paste your code for the three functions rabbitGrowth, foxGrowth, and runSimulation in the following box.

# WARNING
# DO NOT define the global variables MAXRABBITPOP, CURRENTRABBITPOP, or CURRENTFOXPOP in this box. We alter the values of these variables
# to test your code. If you define the variables in this box, you may overwrite our values, causing your code to be marked incorrect.

# CLARIFICATIONS / HINTS
# "See Full Output": If you are getting the line "0 10" in your output for "Test 4 foxGrowth" then for this particular test, your code
# changes the CURRENTFOXPOP (increases it if the fox population has gone below the minimum fox population), which is not the right
# behavior -- the code should not reset CURRENTFOXPOP.
# It is not correct to assume that there is a 1/3 chance that the population increases in "Test 3 foxGrowth". Pay special attention to
# the following statement in the docstring of foxGrowth(): "Each fox, based on the probabilities in the problem statement, may eat one
# rabbit (but only if there are more than 10 rabbits)."
